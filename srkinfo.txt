Mini bio
Known for his trademark gelled spiked up crew cut with sunglasses, Shah Rukh
Khan (SRK) is an Indian Bollywood movie star, movie producer, magazine model,
showman, public speaker, author, philanthropist and television host/personality
working predominantly in Hindi cinema.
Khan began his on-camera acting debut in 1987 at the age of 21 by guest starring in
various Indian serial drama soap opera TV shows as well as appearing in numerous
television commercials and brand advertisements for products. He studied theatre
arts and drama during his second year of college after participating in numerous
school plays. He landed a few acting gigs in Delhi, before acting on Indian TV and
became popular. Khan came down to Mumbai to shoot a TV series with self doubt
and under confidence. So he came for a year to give it a shot. He began auditioningfor starring roles in Hindi movies in 1990 after the death of his mother (his father
died a decade earlier in 1980). Khan's parents died early, which made him
heartbroken in Delhi. Khan decided to pursue a full-time acting career and
relocating to Mumbai to start afresh, hoping to enjoy acting and overcome the
dejecting death of his parents, as there was nothing for him to go back to. He began
auditioning for starring roles in Hindi movies in 1990 after the death of his mother
(his father died a decade earlier in 1980).
After recuperating from a career-ending sports injury, he landed his breakout
breakthrough feature film starring role in the Silver screen in June 1992, and rose to
prominence in the mid-to-late 1990s. Khan shot to stardom in his first feature film
"Deewana" (1992) which won him the first of 13 Filmfare awards -- the Bollywood
equivalent of an Oscar. He continued starring in blockbuster movies throughout the
2000s with a mixed bag of career fluctuations, establishing himself as a very
bankable, versatile movie star in the early-to-mid 2010s. Following a 4-year
sabbatical hiatus in the wake of the corona-virus pandemic, Khan made a
resurgence comeback in 2023, and continues to act and star in A-Lister blockbuster
movies.
Referred to in the media as the "Baadshah of Bollywood" and "King Khan", he has
appeared in over 100 films, and earned numerous accolades, including 14 Filmfare
Awards.
He has been awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India, as well as the
Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and Legion of Honour by the Government of France.
Khan has a significant following in Asia and the Indian diaspora worldwide. In terms
of audience size and income, several media outlets have described him as one of
the most successful film stars in the world. Many of his films depict and portray
Indian national identity, Indian patriotism, and connections with diaspora
communities, or gender, racial, social and religious differences and grievances.
Shah Rukh Khan has been TAG Heuer's brand ambassador in India since September
2003 & is close friends with Amir. He is Bollywood's most bankable movie starswith brand endorsements & resides in the affluent suburbs of Bandra, Mumbai, India
with his wife and children.

speaking, I wouldn't see any of the romantic films I've acted in.

for. So I don't surround myself with guards, I've never given an interview in which I've
said I feel bad that I can't go shopping or I can't go to Chowpatty and eat bhelpuri
without being mobbed. I'm not the kind of guy who goes out wearing dark glasses (I
don't think I'm a big enough star to hide behind them, honest). I go to see movies in
the cinema theatres, I go to restaurants with my family and friends even though I
know people are going to disturb me there.

___________________________________________________________________________________________________


1988–1992: Television and film debut
Khan's first starring role was in Lekh Tandon's television series Dil Dariya, which
began shooting in 1988, but production delays led to the Raj Kumar
Kapoor directed 1989 series Fauji becoming his television debut instead.[41] In
the series, which depicted a realistic look at the training of army cadets, he
played the leading role of Abhimanyu Rai.[42][43] This led to further
appearances in Aziz Mirza's television series Circus (1989–90) and Mani Kaul's
miniseries Idiot (1992).[44] Khan also played minor parts in the
serials Umeed (1989) and Wagle Ki Duniya (1988–90),[44] and in the English-
language television film In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones (1989).[45] His
appearances in these serials led critics to compare his look and acting style
with those of the film actor Dilip Kumar,[46] but Khan was not interested in film
acting at the time, thinking that he was not good enough.[44][47]
Khan changed his decision to act in films in April 1991,[48] citing it as a way to
escape the grief of his mother's death.[49] He moved from Delhi to Mumbai to
pursue a full-time career in Bollywood and was quickly signed to four films.
[48] His first offer was for Hema Malini's directorial debut Dil Aashna Hai,[34]
[42] and by June, he had started his first shoot.[50] His film debut was
in Deewana, which was released in June 1992.[51] In it he starred
alongside Divya Bharti as the second male lead behind Rishi
Kapoor. Deewana became a box office hit and launched Khan's Bollywood
career;[52] he earned the Filmfare Best Male Debut Award for his performance.
[53] Also released in 1992 were Khan's first films as the male
lead, Chamatkar, Dil Aashna Hai, and the comedy Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman,
which was his first of many collaborations with the actress Juhi Chawla.[54] His
initial film roles saw him play characters who displayed energy and
enthusiasm. According to Arnab Ray of Daily News and Analysis, Khan brought
a new kind of acting as he was "sliding down stairs on a slab of ice,
cartwheeling, somersaulting, lips trembling, eyes trembling, bringing to the
screen the kind of physical energy ... visceral, intense, maniacal one moment
and cloyingly boyish the next."[55]
1993–1994: Negative characters
Among his 1993 releases, Khan garnered the most appreciation for portraying
villainous roles in two box office hits: a murderer in Baazigar, and an obsessive
lover in Darr.[56] The former, in which Khan played an ambiguous avenger who
murders his girlfriend, shocked Indian audiences with an unexpected violation
of the standard Bollywood formula.[57] In The Cambridge Companion to Modern
Indian Culture, Sonal Khullar called the character "the consummate anti-hero".
[58] His performance in Baazigar, which would be his first of many appearances
with actress Kajol, won Khan his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor.[59] In 2003,
the Encyclopaedia of Hindi Cinema stated that Khan "defied the image of the
conventional hero in both these films and created his own version of the
revisionist hero".[59] Darr marked the first of Khan's many collaborations with
filmmaker Yash Chopra and his company Yash Raj Films. Khan's stammering
and the use of the phrase "I love you, K-k-k-Kiran" were popular with audiences.
[60] Malini Mannath of The Indian Express argued that he "walks away with the
acting honours in yet another negative role".[61] For Darr he received a
nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Negative Role, also
known as the Best Villain Award, but lost to Paresh Rawal for Sir.[62] Also in1993, Khan performed a nude scene with Deepa Sahi in Maya Memsaab,
although parts of it were censored by the Central Board of Film Certification.
[63] The ensuing controversy prompted him to eschew such scenes in future
roles.[64]
In 1994, Khan played a love-struck musician in Kundan Shah's comedy-drama
film Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa opposite Deepak Tijori and Suchitra Krishnamurthy,
which he later professed was his favourite role. His performance earned him
a Filmfare Critics Award for Best Performance, and in a retrospective review
from 2004, Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com referred to it as Khan's best
performance, calling him "spontaneous, vulnerable, boyish, mischievous and
acting straight from the heart".[65] Also in 1994, Khan won the Filmfare Best
Villain Award for his role as an obsessive lover in Anjaam, co-starring Madhuri
Dixit.[59] At the time, playing antagonistic roles was considered risky to a
leading man's career in mainstream Hindi cinema. Arnab Ray subsequently
credited Khan for taking "insane risks" and "pushing the envelope" by choosing
to play such characters, through which he established his career.[55] The
director Mukul S. Anand called him "the new face of the industry" at the time.
[49]
1995–1998: Romantic roles
Kajol in 2014 celebrating 1000 weeks continuous showing
of their film Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge
Khan starred in seven films in 1995, the first of which was Rakesh Roshan's
melodramatic thriller Karan Arjun. Co-starring Salman Khan and Kajol, it
became the second-highest-grossing film of the year in India.[66] His most
significant release that year was Aditya Chopra's directorial debut, the
romance Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, in which he played a young Non-resident
Indian (NRI) who falls in love with Kajol's character during a trip across Europe.
Khan was initially reticent to portray the role of a lover, but this film is credited
with establishing him as a "romantic hero".[67] Lauded by both critics and the
public, it became the year's highest grossing production in India and abroad
and was declared an "all time blockbuster" by Box Office India,[66][68] with an
estimated lifetime gross of ₹2 billion (US$61.68 million) worldwide.[69][70] It is
the longest-running film in the history of Indian cinema; it is still showing at
the Maratha Mandir theatre in Mumbai after more than 1000 weeks as of early
2015.[71][72] The film won ten Filmfare Awards, including the second of Khan's
Best Actor Awards.[59] The director and critic Raja Sen said, "Khan gives a
fabulous performance, redefining the lover for the 1990s with great panache.
He's cool and flippant, but sincere enough to appeal to the [audience]. Theperformance itself is, like the best in the business, played well enough to come
across as effortless, as non-acting."[73]
In 1996, all four of Khan's releases failed critically and commercially, [74] but the
following year, his starring role opposite Aditya Pancholi and Juhi Chawla in Aziz
Mirza's romantic comedy Yes Boss earned him accolades that included a
Filmfare Best Actor nomination.[62] Later in 1997, he starred in Subhash Ghai's
diasporic-themed social drama Pardes,[75] portraying Arjun, a musician facing a
moral dilemma. India Today cites it as one of the first major Bollywood pictures
to succeed in the United States.[76] Khan's final release of 1997 was the second
collaboration with Yash Chopra in the popular musical romance Dil To Pagal Hai.
He portrayed Rahul, a stage director caught in a love triangle between Madhuri
Dixit and Karisma Kapoor. The film and his performance met with critical
praise, winning Khan his third Best Actor Award at Filmfare.[59]
Khan performed the lead role in three films and made one special appearance
in 1998. In his first release of the year, he played a double role opposite Juhi
Chawla and Sonali Bendre in Mahesh Bhatt's action comedy Duplicate, the first
of his many collaborations with Yash Johar's production company Dharma
Productions. The film was not well received,[77] but India Today lauded Khan for
his energetic performance.[78] The same year, Khan won critical praise for his
performance as an All India Radio correspondent who develops an infatuation
for a mysterious terrorist (Manisha Koirala) in Dil Se..,[79] the third instalment
of Mani Ratnam's trilogy of terror films.[80][81] In his final release of the year, he
portrayed a college student in Karan Johar's romance Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, in
which he was involved in a love triangle along with Kajol and Rani Mukerji. The
writer Anjana Motihar Chandra has referred to the picture as the blockbuster of
the 1990s, a "pot-pourri of romance, comedy, and entertainment."[82] Khan
won the Best Actor award at the Filmfare Awards ceremony for the second
consecutive year,[59] although he and several critics believed his performance
to have been overshadowed by that of Kajol.[83]
The roles in this phase of his career, and the series of romantic comedies and
family dramas that followed, earned Khan widespread adulation from
audiences, particularly teenagers,[84] and according to the author Anupama
Chopra, established him as an icon of romance in India.[85][86] He continued to
have frequent professional associations with Yash Chopra, Aditya Chopra,
and Karan Johar, who moulded his image and made him into a superstar.
[87] Khan became a romantic leading man without ever actually kissing any of
his co-stars,[85] although he broke this rule in 2012, after strong urging by Yash
Chopra.[88]1999–2003: Career fluctuations
Khan's only release in 1999 was Baadshah, in which he starred
opposite Twinkle Khanna. Although the film underperformed at the box office,
[89] it earned him a Filmfare Award nomination for Best Performance in a Comic
Role.[62] Khan became a producer in 1999 in a collaboration with the actress
Juhi Chawla and the director Aziz Mirza for a production company called
Dreamz Unlimited.[90] The company's first production, Phir Bhi Dil Hai
Hindustani (2000), starring Khan and Chawla, was a commercial failure.[91] It
was released one week after Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai, starring Hrithik Roshan,
then a newcomer, who critics believed overshadowed Khan.[92] Swapna Mitter
of Rediff.com spoke of Khan's predictable mannerisms, saying "Frankly, it's high
time he innovated his act a little."[93] Khan did a supporting role in Kamal
Haasan's Hey Ram (2000), which was made simultaneously in Tamil and Hindi.
He thereby made his Tamil debut by playing the role of an archaeologist named
Amjad Khan.[94] He performed free of charge as he wanted to work with
Haasan.[95][96] On Khan's performance, T. Krithika Reddy of The Hindu wrote,
"Shah Rukh Khan, as usual comes up with an impeccable performance." [94]
In 2001, Dreamz Unlimited attempted a comeback with Khan portraying the
title role in Santosh Sivan's historical epic Aśoka, a partly fictionalised account
of the life of emperor Ashoka. The film was screened at the Venice Film
Festival and the 2001 Toronto International Film Festival to a positive response,
[97] but it performed poorly at Indian box offices.[98] As losses continued to
mount for the production company,[92] Khan was forced to close srkworld.com,
a company that he had started along with Dreamz Unlimited.[99] In December
2001, Khan suffered a spinal injury while performing an action sequence for a
special appearance in Krishna Vamsi's Shakti: The Power.[100] He was
subsequently diagnosed with a prolapsed disc, and attempted
multiple alternative therapies. None of these provided a permanent solution to
the injury, which caused him severe pain while shooting several of his films.
[100][101] By the beginning of 2003, his condition had worsened to the point that
he had to undergo anterior cervical discectomy and fusion surgery
at Wellington Hospital, London.[102][103][104] Khan resumed shooting in June
2003, but he reduced his workload and the number of film roles he accepted
annually.[101]Aishwarya Rai at the home video launch of their
film Devdas (2002)
Successes during this time included Aditya Chopra's Mohabbatein (2000), and
Karan Johar's family drama Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001),[91][105] which
Khan cites as a turning point in his career.[106] Both films co-starred Amitabh
Bachchan as an authoritarian figure, and presented ideological struggles
between the two men.[107][108] Khan's performances in the films were met with
wide public appreciation, and he was awarded his second Filmfare Critics Award
for Best Actor for Mohabbatein.[62][109] Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... remained
the top-grossing Indian production of all time in the overseas market for the
next five years.[110]
In 2002, Khan played the title role as a rebellious alcoholic opposite Aishwarya
Rai and Madhuri Dixit in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's period romance Devdas. At a
cost of over ₹500 million (US$10.29 million), it was the most expensive
Bollywood film ever made at the time,[111] and became a box office success,
earning approximately ₹1.68 billion ($35 million) worldwide.[112] The film
earned numerous accolades including 10 Filmfare Awards, with Best Actor for
Khan,[53] and a BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language.
[113] Khan next starred in Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003), a comedy-drama written by
Karan Johar and set in New York City, which became the second-highest-
grossing film domestically and the top-grossing Bollywood film in external
markets that year.[105][114] Co-starring with Jaya Bachchan, Saif Ali Khan,
and Preity Zinta, Khan received critical praise for his portrayal of Aman Mathur,
a man with a fatal heart disease, with critics praising his emotional impact
upon audiences.[115] Conflict broke out between Khan and the other partners of
Dreamz Unlimited over the failure to cast Juhi Chawla in their 2003 production
of Aziz Mirza's Chalte Chalte, and they parted ways, despite the film's success.
[116]
2004–2009: Comeback
2004 was a critically and commercially successful year for Khan. He
transformed Dreamz Unlimited into Red Chillies Entertainment, adding his wife
Gauri as a producer.[117] In the company's first production, he starred in Farah
Khan's directorial debut, the masala film Main Hoon Na. A fictionalised account
of India–Pakistan relations, it was viewed by some commentators as a
conscious effort to move away from the stereotypical portrayal of Pakistan asthe constant villain.[118] Khan then played an Indian Air Force pilot who falls in
love with a Pakistani woman (Preity Zinta) in Yash Chopra's romance film Veer-
Zaara, which was screened at the 55th Berlin Film Festival to critical praise.
[119] It was the highest earning film of 2004 in India, with a worldwide gross of
over ₹940 million (US$20.74 million), and Main Hoon Na was the second-
highest earner with ₹680 million (US$15.01 million).[110][120]
Priyanka Chopra at the premiere for Don in 2006
In his final release of 2004, Khan starred as a NASA scientist who patriotically
returns to India to rekindle his roots in Ashutosh Gowariker's social
drama Swades (meaning "Homeland"), which became the first Indian picture to
be shot inside the NASA research centre at the Kennedy Space Center in
Florida.[121] Film scholar Stephen Teo refers to the picture as an example of
"Bollywoodised realism", displaying a transcendence in conventional narrative
and audience expectation in Hindi cinema.[122] In December 2013, The Times
of India reported that Khan found filming the picture such an emotionally
overwhelming and life-changing experience that he had still not viewed the
film.[123] Derek Elley of Variety found Khan's performance "unsettling" as "a
self-satisfied expatriate determined to bring Western values to poor Indian
peasants",[124] but several film critics, including Jitesh Pillai, believed it to have
been his finest acting to date.[125][126] He was nominated for the Filmfare Best
Actor Award for all three of his 2004 releases and eventually won the award
for Swades.[53][62] Filmfare later included his performance in the 2010 issue of
Bollywood's "Top 80 Iconic Performances".[127]
In 2005, Khan starred in Amol Palekar's fantasy drama, Paheli. The film was
India's submission for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 79th Academy
Awards.[128] He later collaborated with Karan Johar for the third time in the
musical romantic drama Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006), in which he played an
unhappily married man who has an extramarital affair with a married woman.
The film, which featured an ensemble cast including Amitabh
Bachchan, Abhishek Bachchan, Rani Mukerji, Preity Zinta and Kirron Kher,
emerged as India's highest-grossing film in the overseas market,[105] earning
more than ₹1.13 billion (US$25.62 million) worldwide.[110] Both his roles
in Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna and the action film Don, a remake of the 1978 film of
the same name, earned Khan Best Actor nominations at the Filmfare Awards,
[129] despite his performance as the titular character in Don being negatively
compared to that of Amitabh Bachchan in the original film.[130][131]"Such great things have happened to such a normal guy like me. I am a
nobody who shouldn't have been able to do all this but I have done it. I tell
everyone that there's this myth I work for; there is this myth called Shahrukh
Khan and I am his employee. I have to live up to that ... I'll do it, I am an
actor. But I can't start believing in this myth."
—Khan reflecting in 2007 on his position as the Hindi film industry's top star [132]
In 2007, Khan portrayed a disgraced hockey player who coached the Indian
women's national hockey team to World Cup success in Yash Raj Films' semi-
fictional Chak De! India. Bhaichand Patel notes that Khan, who had a
background in the sport playing for his university's hockey team,
[133] essentially portrayed himself as a "cosmopolitan, liberal, Indian Muslim".
[134] Faring well in both India and abroad,[110][135] Khan garnered another
Filmfare Award for Best Actor for his performance,[53] which Rajeev
Masand of CNN-IBN considers to have been "without any of his typical
trappings, without any of his trademark quirks", portraying Kabir Khan "like a
real flesh-and-blood human being".[136] Filmfare included his performance in
their 2010 issue of the "Top 80 Iconic Performances".[137] In the same year,
Khan starred alongside Arjun Rampal, Deepika Padukone and Shreyas
Talpade in Farah Khan's reincarnation melodrama Om Shanti Om, portraying a
1970s junior artiste who is reborn as a 2000s era superstar. The film became
the highest grossing Indian motion picture of 2007, both domestically and
abroad.[105][138] Om Shanti Om earned Khan his second nomination of the year
for Best Actor at Filmfare.[139] Khalid Mohammed from Hindustan Times wrote,
"the enterprise belongs to Shah Rukh Khan, who tackles comedy, high drama
and action with his signature style—spontaneous and intuitively intelligent".
[140]
Khan collaborated for the third time with Aditya Chopra on the romantic
comedy Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (2008) opposite debutante Anushka Sharma. He
played Surinder Sahni, a shy man with low self-esteem, whose love for his
young arranged wife (Sharma) causes him to transform himself into Raj, a
boisterous alter-ego. Rachel Saltz of The New York Times believed the dual role
to have been "tailor-made" for Khan, allowing him to display his talents,
[141] although Deep Contractor from Epilogue thought Khan displayed greater
strength in the role of Surinder and weakness in the role of monologue-prone
Raj.[142] In December 2008, Khan suffered a shoulder injury while filming a
small role in Mudassar Aziz's Dulha Mil Gaya. He underwent extensive
physiotherapy sessions at the time but the pain left him almost immobile and
he had arthroscopic surgery in February 2009.[143][144] He performed a special
appearance in the 2009 film Billu, playing Bollywood superstar Sahir Khan—a
fictionalised version of himself, wherein he performed musical item
numbers with actresses Kareena Kapoor, Priyanka Chopra, and Deepika
Padukone.[145] As head of the film's production company, Red Chillies, Khan
made the call to change the title of the film from Billu Barber to Billu after
hairdressers across the country complained that the word "barber" was
derogatory. The company covered up the offending word on billboards that had
already been installed with the original title.[146]2010–2014: Expansion to action and comedy
Karan Johar and co-star Kajol at an event for My Name Is
Khan in 2010
After refusing the role that subsequently went to Anil Kapoor in Danny
Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire (2008), Khan began shooting My Name Is
Khan (2010), his fourth collaboration with director Karan Johar and his sixth
with Kajol.[147] The film is based on a true story and set against the backdrop of
perceptions of Islam after the 11 September attacks. Khan plays Rizwan Khan,
a Muslim suffering from mild Asperger syndrome who sets out on a journey
across America to meet the country's president, a role that film scholar
Stephen Teo sees as a "symbol of assertive rasa values" and another example
of Khan representing NRI identity in global Bollywood.[148] To provide an
accurate portrayal of a sufferer without disparagement, Khan spent several
months researching his role by reading books, watching videos and talking to
people affected by the condition.[149][150] Upon release, My Name is
Khan became one of the highest grossing Bollywood films of all time outside
India,[110][105] and earned Khan his eighth Filmfare Award for Best Actor,
[53] equalling the record for the most wins in the category with Dilip Kumar.
[151] Jay Wesissberg from Variety noted how Khan portrayed the Asperger's
sufferer with "averted eyes, springy steps, [and] stuttered repetitions of
memorized texts", believing it to have been a "standout performance sure to
receive the Autism Society's gold seal of approval".[152]
In 2011, Khan starred alongside Arjun Rampal and Kareena Kapoor in Anubhav
Sinha's superhero film Ra.One, his first work in this subgenre, as a favour to his
children.[153] The film follows the story of a London-based video game designer
who creates a villainous character who escapes into the real world. It was billed
as Bollywood's most expensive production; it had an estimated budget of ₹1.25
billion (US$26.78 million).[154][155] Despite negative media coverage of the
film's box office performance, Ra.One was a financial success with a gross
of ₹2.4 billion (US$51.42 million).[156][157] The film, and Khan's portrayal of a
dual role, received mixed reviews; while most critics praised his performance
as the robotic superhero G.One, they criticised his portrayal of the video game
designer Shekhar.[158] Khan's second release of 2011 was Don 2, a sequel
to Don (2006).[159] To prepare for his role, Khan exercised extensively as he
performed most of the stunts himself.[160] His performance earned him positive
reviews from critics; Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India said, "Shah Rukh
remains in command and never loses his foothold, neither through the
dramatic sequences nor through the action cuts".[161] The year's highest
grossing Bollywood production abroad,[162][163] it was showcased at the 62nd
Berlin International Film Festival.[164]Chennai Express in 2013
Khan's only release in 2012 was Yash Chopra's swan song,[165] the romantic
drama Jab Tak Hai Jaan, which saw him once again in a romantic role, starring
opposite Katrina Kaif and Anushka Sharma. CNN-IBN considered the overall
performance by Khan to have been one of his finest to date, but believed that
Khan's first screen kiss of his career with Katrina Kaif, twenty years his junior,
was an awkward one.[88][166] Jab Tak Hai Jaan was a moderate financial success
earning over ₹2.11 billion (US$39.49 million) worldwide.[167][168] The film was
showcased at the 2012 Marrakech International Film Festival in Morocco, along
with Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham..., Veer-Zaara, and Don 2.[169] At the
following Zee Cine Awards, Khan performed a tribute to the late Yash Chopra
along with Kaif, Sharma, and several of Chopra's other past heroines.[170]
In 2013, Khan starred in Rohit Shetty's action comedy Chennai Express for Red
Chillies Entertainment, a film which earned mixed critical reviews and
extensive criticism for its perceived disparagement of South Indian culture,
though the film included a tribute to Tamil cinema star Rajinikanth.[171] Critic
Khalid Mohamed thought that Khan overacted in the film and criticised him for
"re-rendering every old trick in the acting book".[172] Despite the criticism, the
film broke many box office records for Hindi films in both India and abroad,
surpassing 3 Idiots to briefly become the highest grossing Bollywood film of all
time, with a gross of almost ₹4 billion (US$68.26 million) in worldwide ticket
sales.[173][174] On International Women's Day in 2013, The Times of
India reported that Khan had requested a new convention with the name of his
lead female co-stars appearing above his own in the credits. He claimed that
the women in his life, including his co-stars, have been the reason for his
success.[175] In 2014, the actor was featured in Farah Khan's ensemble action
comedy Happy New Year, which co-starred Deepika Padukone, Abhishek
Bachchan and Boman Irani; his third collaboration with the director.
[176] Although Khan's unidimensional character was criticised, [177] the film
became a major commercial success grossing ₹3.8 billion (US$64.85 million)
worldwide.[178][179][180]2015–2022: Career setbacks and hiatus
Khan next appeared alongside Kajol, Varun Dhawan and Kriti Sanon in Rohit
Shetty's action comedy Dilwale (2015). The film garnered mixed reviews,
though it was financially profitable with a gross of ₹3.7 billion (US$57.68
million).[181] Namrata Joshi of The Hindu commented, "With Dilwale, Rohit
Shetty goes hopelessly wrong despite much that he had at his disposal,
including a power-packed cast and producer", and felt that the attempt to
repackage Khan and Kajol had backfired.[182] He then took on dual parts of a
superstar and his doppelgänger fan in Maneesh Sharma's action
thriller Fan (2016). Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian considered the film to be
"exhausting, bizarre yet watchable" and thought that Khan was aptly "creepy"
as the obsessive admirer.[183] The film underperformed at the box office, and
trade journalists attributed this failure to the film's non-conformity to
mainstream formula.[184] Later that year, Khan portrayed the supporting part of
a therapist to an aspiring cinematographer (Alia Bhatt) in Gauri Shinde's
coming-of-age film Dear Zindagi.[185]
In Rahul Dholakia's action crime film Raees (2017), Khan took on the part of the
titular anti-hero—a bootlegger turned mobster in 1980s Gujarat. In a typical
mixed review, Pratim D. Gupta of The Telegraph thought Khan's performance to
be "inconsistent, intense and power-packed at times, but often slipping out of
character into his usual mix of stock mannerisms".[186] Commercially, the film
was a modest success, earning about ₹3.08 billion (US$47.3 million) worldwide.
[187][188] Khan returned to the romantic genre with the role of a tourist guide
who falls in love with a traveller (Anushka Sharma) in Imtiaz Ali's Jab Harry Met
Sejal (2017). In a review for Mint, Uday Bhatia criticised Khan's pairing with
Sharma, 22 years his junior, writing that Khan had performed "similar gestures
of love decades ago to actors his own age".[189] He reunited with Sharma and
Katrina Kaif in Aanand L Rai's romantic drama Zero (2018), in which he played
Bauua Singh, a dwarf involved in a love triangle.[190][191] The film received
mixed reviews with praise directed to Khan's performance.[192][193] Writing
for Hindustan Times, Raja Sen commended his "dominating performance and
tremendous energy" and Anna M. M. Vetticad of Firstpost called him an
"excellent fit" for the role for allowing his "naturally energetic personality,
comic timing and charm to take flight".[194][195] Both Jab Harry Met
Sejal and Zero were box office flops.[196][197]According to a Box Office India report, Khan's stardom was impacted by his
films failing to do well.[198] Following the release of Zero, Khan took a four-year
break from full-time acting, which was partly caused by the COVID-19
pandemic in India. He took the time off to attempt a career comeback.
[199] During this period, he made extended special appearances in the 2022
films Brahmāstra: Part One – Shiva and Rocketry: The Nambi Effect.[200]
2023–present: Resurgence
In 2023, Khan reunited with Yash Raj Films in the action thriller Pathaan (2023),
set in the YRF Spy Universe, in which he played an exiled field agent assigned
to stop a terrorist attack in India.[201] Critic Sukanya Verma took note of Khan's
"weathered intensity, grizzly charisma and trademark wit", while Kaveree
Bamzai termed it a "much-needed makeover" of an ageing Khan into an action
star.[202][203] Pathaan broke several box-office records, thus re-establishing
Khan's stardom.[204][205] Khan took on another action film role in the same year
in Atlee's Jawan, playing father and son doppelgängers.[206] Nandini Ramnath
of Scroll.in wrote that "Khan's screen image – expansive, suffused with love,
heroic in an old-fashioned way without being aggressively macho, irreverent
but also sincere – helps sell a conceit that might have crashed with any other
actor".[207] Jawan broke the records set by Pathaan.[208] Both films grossed
over ₹10 billion (US$120 million) to rank, respectively, as Hindi cinema's
second and third biggest grossers worldwide,[209] making Khan the first Indian
actor to deliver two films that earned over ₹10 billion.[210]
In his final release of 2023, Khan starred in Rajkumar Hirani's Dunki, a social
drama about an illegal immigration technique named donkey flight.[211]
[212] Uday Bhatia wrote that his role as a "romantic feminist soldier patriot
friend" marked "a break from Khan the action star but offers no respite from
the Khan the perfect screen idol".[213] Grossing over ₹4
billion (US$47 million), Dunki emerged as Khan's third consecutive commercial
success of the year, although it did not match up to the record grosses
of Pathaan or Jawan.[214][215]
Khan will continue his work in action films when starring with his daughter
in Siddharth Anand's King, which will release in 2026.[216]Other work
Film production and television hosting
61st Filmfare Awards in 2016, which Khan hosted along with Kapil
Sharma
Khan co-produced three films from 1999 to 2003 as a founding member of the
partnership Dreamz Unlimited.[90] After the partnership was dissolved, he and
Gauri restructured the company as Red Chillies Entertainment,[117] which
includes divisions dealing with film and television production, visual effects,
and advertising.[217] As of 2015, the company has produced or co-produced at
least nine films.[218] Either Khan or Gauri are usually given production credits,
and he has appeared in most of the films, either in the lead role, or in a guest
appearance. Khan was involved in several aspects of the making
of Ra.One (2011). Aside from acting, he produced the film, volunteered to write
the console game script, dubbed for it, oversaw its technical development, and
wrote the digital comics based on the film's characters.[219][220] Khan has
occasionally done playback singing for his films. In Josh (2000) he sang the
popular song "Apun Bola Tu Meri Laila". He also sang in Don (2006) and Jab Tak
Hai Jaan (2012).[221] For Always Kabhi Kabhi (2011), which was produced by
Red Chillies, Khan participated in the lyrical composition.[222]
In addition to his early television serial appearances, Khan has hosted
numerous televised awards shows, including the Filmfare, Zee Cine, and Screen
Awards.[223][224][225] In 2007, he replaced Amitabh Bachchan for one season as
the host of Kaun Banega Crorepati, the Indian version of Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire?,[226] and a year later, Khan began hosting Kya Aap Paanchvi Pass
Se Tez Hain?, the Indian version of Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?.[227] In
2011, he returned to television, appearing on Imagine TV's Zor Ka Jhatka: Total
Wipeout, the Indian version of Wipeout; scenes featuring Khan were shot at
the Yash Raj Studios in Mumbai.[228] Contrary to his earlier television anchoring
jobs, Zor Ka Jhatka: Total Wipeout performed poorly. It aired for only one season
and became the lowest rated show hosted by a Bollywood star.[228] In 2017,
Khan began hosting TED Talks India Nayi Soch, a talk show produced by TED
Conferences, LLC which started aired on STAR Plus.[229]Stage performances
Khan is a frequent stage performer and has participated in several world tours
and concerts. In 1997, he performed in Asha Bhosle's Moments in Time concert
in Malaysia, and returned the following year to perform with Karisma Kapoor for
the Shahrukh–Karisma: Live in Malaysia concert.[230] The same year, he
participated in The Awesome Foursome world tour across the United Kingdom,
Canada, and the United States along with Juhi Chawla, Akshay Kumar and Kajol,
and resumed the tour in Malaysia the following year.[231][232] In 2002, Khan
featured with Amitabh Bachchan, Aamir Khan, Preity Zinta, and Aishwarya
Rai in the show From India With Love at Manchester's Old
Trafford and London's Hyde Park; the event was attended by more than
100,000 people.[233] Khan performed alongside Rani Mukherji, Arjun
Rampal and Ishaa Koppikar in a 2010 concert at the St. Joseph High School
field in Dhaka, Bangladesh.[234] The next year he joined Shahid
Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra in the Friendship Concert, celebrating 150 years
of India–South Africa friendship in Durban, South Africa.[235]
Khan started an association with the "Temptations" series of concert tours by
singing, dancing, and performing skits alongside Arjun Rampal, Priyanka
Chopra, and other Bollywood stars in Temptations 2004, a stage show that
toured 22 venues across the world.[236] The show played to 15,000 spectators
at Dubai's Festival City Arena.[237] In 2008, Khan set up Temptation Reloaded, a
series of concerts that toured several countries, including the Netherlands.
[238] He performed alongside Dino Morea , Rani Mukerji, and Dia Mirza at
the Airtel-Bindass concert tour in 2008.[239][240] Another tour was held
with Bipasha Basu and others in 2012 in Jakarta,[241] and in 2013 another
series of concerts visited Auckland, Perth and Sydney.[242] In 2014, Khan
performed in SLAM! The Tour in the US, Canada, and London,[243] and also
hosted the Indian premiere of the live talent show, Got Talent World Stage Live.
[244]
Ownership of Kolkata Knight Riders
In 2008, Khan, in partnership with Juhi Chawla and her husband Jay Mehta,
acquired ownership rights for the franchise representing Kolkata in
the Twenty20 cricket tournament Indian Premier League (IPL)
for US$75.09 million, and named the team Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR).[245] As
of 2009, KKR was one of the richest teams in the IPL, with a brand value
of US$42.1 million.[246] The team performed poorly on the field during the first
three years.[247] Their performance improved over time, and they became the
champions for the first time in 2012[247] and repeated the feat in 2014.[248] The
Knight Riders hold the record for the longest winning streak by any Indian team
in T20s (14).[249] They won their third IPL title in the 2024 edition.[250]
Khan performed alongside Sunidhi Chauhan and Shriya Saran at the opening
ceremony of the IPL 2011 season, where they danced to Tamil songs.[251] He
appeared again in 2013 alongside Katrina Kaif, Deepika Padukone and Pitbull.
[252] In May 2012, the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) banned him from
the Wankhede Stadium for five years for getting into an argument with the
security staff after a match between KKR and the Mumbai Indians.[253] Khan
had, however, stated that he acted only after children, including his daughter,
were being "manhandled" by the security staff[253][254] and that the officials
were extremely high-handed and aggressive in their behaviour,[255] he hadbeen abused with communal indecent comment.[254] Later MCA officials had
accused him of being drunk in one version of the story, hitting the guard and of
completely uncharacteristically abusing a female supporter of Mumbai Indians
after the match in another version of the story, which Khan had maintained it
was done to support their action and for cheap publicity.[254][256][257] Wankhede
guard later contradicted MCA officials' claim and said Shah Rukh Khan had not
hit him.[254] Khan later apologised to his fans after his team won the final
match.[258] MCA revoked the ban in 2015[259] and in 2016, Mumbai Police
informed that no 'cognisable offence' was made out against Khan and they had
come to the conclusion that Shah Rukh Khan was not drunk and did not use
abusive language before minors at the Wankhede Stadium in 2012.[256][257]
Appearance in Music Videos
In February 2019, Khan made a special appearance in the music video of the
song BIBA, featuring Marshmello and Shirley Setia, and composed by Pritam.
The video received positive response from fans, and Khan's cameo was well
received.[260]
In June 2025, Khan appeared in an Ed Sheeran song Sapphire, which also
featured vocals from Arijit Singh.[261] The video was shot across various parts of
India, and the song received acclaim from critics and fans.[262]
In the media

Tag Heuer press conference in 2012
Khan receives a considerable amount of media coverage in India, and is often
referred to as "King Khan", "The Baadshah of Bollywood", or "The King of
Bollywood".[b] Anupama Chopra cites him as an "ever present celebrity", with
two or three films a year, constantly running television ads, print ads, and
gigantic billboards lining the streets of Indian cities.[268] He is the object of a
sometimes fanatical following, with a fan base estimated to exceed one billion.
[269] Newsweek named Khan as one of their fifty most powerful people globally
in 2008 and called him "the world's biggest movie star".[270][271] In 2011 he
was described as "the biggest movie star you've never heard of...perhaps the
world's biggest movie star, period" by Steven Zeitchik of the Los AngelesTimes[g][273] and has been called the world's biggest movie star in other
international media outlets.[c] According to a popularity survey, 3.2 billion
people around the world know Khan, more than who know Tom Cruise.[277] In a
2022 readers' poll by Empire magazine, Khan was listed as one of the 50
greatest actors of all time. The magazine attributed his success to the
"outrageous amounts of [his] charisma and absolute mastery of [his] craft.
Comfortable in almost every genre going, there's pretty much nothing he can't
do."[278] In 2023, Time magazine named him one of the 100 most influential
people in the world,[279] and he topped the list per a readers poll.[280]
Khan is one of the wealthiest celebrities in India, topping the Forbes India's
"Celebrity 100 list" in 2012, 2013 and 2015.[281][282][283] His wealth has been
estimated at US$400–600 million.[284][285] Khan owns several properties in India
and abroad, including a £20 million apartment in London,[286] and a villa on
the Palm Jumeirah in Dubai.[287] From 2023–2024, Khan ranked as the highest
tax payer in India.[288]
Khan frequently appears on listings of the most popular, stylish and influential
people in India. He has regularly featured among the top ten on The Times of
India's list of the 50 most desirable men in India,[289][290] and in a 2007 poll by
the magazine Eastern Eye he was named the sexiest man in Asia.[291] Khan is
often referred to as "Brand SRK" by media organisations because of his many
brand endorsement and entrepreneurship ventures.[292][293] He is one of the
highest paid Bollywood endorsers and one of the most visible celebrities in
television advertising, with up to a six per cent share of the television
advertisement market.[294][295] Khan has endorsed brands
including Pepsi, Nokia, Hyundai, Dish TV, D'decor, LUX and TAG Heuer.[295]
[296] Books have been published about him,[297][298] and his popularity has been
documented in several non-fiction films, including the two-part
documentary The Inner and Outer World of Shah Rukh Khan (2005),[299] and
the Discovery Travel & Living channel's ten-part miniseries Living with a
Superstar—Shah Rukh Khan (2010).[294] In 2007, Khan became the third Indian
actor to have his wax statue installed at London's Madame Tussauds museum,
after Aishwarya Rai and Amitabh Bachchan.[300][301] Additional versions of the
statue were installed at Madame Tussauds' museums in Los Angeles, Hong
Kong, New York and Washington.[302]
Khan has been brand ambassador of various governmental campaigns,
including Pulse Polio and the National AIDS Control Organisation.[296] He is a
member of the board of directors of the Make-A-Wish Foundation in India,
[303] and in 2011 he was appointed by UNOPS as the first global ambassador of
the Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council.[304] He has recorded a
series of public service announcements championing good health and proper
nutrition, and joined India's Health Ministry and UNICEF in a nationwide child
immunisation campaign.[305] In 2011, he received UNESCO's Pyramide con
Marni award for his charitable commitment to provide education for children,
becoming the first Indian to win the accolade.[306] In 2014, Khan became the
ambassador for Interpol's campaign "Turn Back Crime".[307] In 2015, Khan
received a privileged degree from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland.[308] In
2018, Khan was honoured by the World Economic Forum with their annual
Crystal Award for his leadership in championing children's and women's rights
in India.[309][310]In October 2019, Khan featured in a video launched by Prime Minister Narendra
Modi to pay tribute to Mahatma Gandhi on his 150th birth anniversary. The
preview of the video, which took place on 20 October 2019 at PMO, was
attended by Khan, along with Aamir Khan, Kangana Ranaut, Rajkumar
Hirani, Jacqueline Fernandez, Sonam Kapoor, Ekta Kapoor, Varun Sharma, Jackie
Shroff, Imtiaz Ali, Sonu Nigam, Kapil Sharma, and many other dignitaries.[311]
[312][313] Khan's distinctive voice and mannerisms have inspired many imitators
and voice actors.[314] In the Hindi-dubbed version of the cartoon series Oggy
and the Cockroaches, Saurav Chakrabarti emulates Khan's voice for the
character Oggy.[315]
In April 2020, Khan announced a series of initiatives to help the government of
India and the state governments of Maharashtra, West Bengal, and Delhi
mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic as well as relief measures for thousands of
underprivileged people and daily wage labourers affected by the lockdown.[316]
[317] He offered his 4-storey personal office space to the Brihanmumbai
Municipal Corporation to be used as a quarantine centre for coronavirus
patients.[318]
On 5 May 2025, Khan attended the Met Gala in Manhattan, becoming the first
Bollywood male actor to do so and making his debut appearance.[319] His outfit
was designed by fashion designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee.[320]
